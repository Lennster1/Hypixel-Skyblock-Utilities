# Hypixel-Skyblock-Utilities

This project is currently in its first phase. Right now, you can enter what item you want and it will search for those prices one the bazaar.  
Probably going to add a minion calculator too, as well as offline mode.  
Requires requests and python to run. You can install requests by going in the command prompt and typing `pip install requests`, assuming you have python installed already.<br> I used python 3.9.5, probably works with 3.4 and above. 
If you don't want to download python and the dependencies, you can use it here: https://replit.com/@Lennsterhurt/Hypixel-Skyblock-Utilities#.replit
Note that everytime you get the prices, you will have to run the program again.
